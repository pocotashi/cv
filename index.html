        <p><em><strong>Fisheries Biologist at <a href="https://www.alaskanobservers.com/"> Alaskan Observers</a></strong></em>.</p>
        <p>I am an individual with an interest in wildlife ecology. I have a masters in biology from College of Staten Island, CUNY.
          One of my interesting work experience has been working as a <em>Fisheries Biologist</em> in the Bering Sea, where I collected data while on-board in a commerical fishing vessel. The data collected is used by NMFS to manage the fisheries in the North West Pacific Ocean.</p>

        <p>Currently, I am polishing my Full-Stack Web Development skills by working on some projects. You can checkout my projects <a href="https://github.com/pocotashi" alt="githubProfile">github.com/pocotashi.</a></p>
